Design requirements
===================

* I want logic separated into independent modules, with clearly defined APIs. That will make it easy to replace a module without changing code all over the place.
* Every module shall have unit tests, to verify the functionality.
* I am going to use Microsoft Visual Code for this project, organized in a git repository.
