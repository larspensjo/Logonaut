# Logonaut Theme Specification: Neon Night (Dark)

This document outlines the general visual goals and aesthetic for the "Neon Night" dark theme for the Logonaut application. Specific color values, fonts, and control styles are defined in the corresponding XAML resource dictionary.

## Overall Aesthetic

*   **Core:** A modern, dark theme using very dark charcoal/grey backgrounds. Depth is primarily achieved through panel layering (using subtle dark shadows) and pronounced glow effects for interactive elements.
*   **Feel:** Conveys a "techy," "developer tool," or "cyberpunk-lite" atmosphere. High contrast (light text on dark backgrounds) is crucial for readability during extended use.
*   **Emphasis:** Pronounced but clean neon glows (using the primary accent color, e.g., electric cyan/blue) are the main visual cue for interactivity, focus, and selection states. Panels should appear to float slightly above the main background.
*   **Interactivity/Focus:** The neon accent color is used for outer glows around focused inputs or selected items, highlighted borders, or background fills for active elements (like toggles or selected list items). Hover effects may involve subtle background lightening or applying the focus glow.
*   **Readability:** Text is generally light grey/off-white against the dark backgrounds. Secondary elements use dimmer greys. Status colors (Error, Warning) should be vibrant against the dark background.
