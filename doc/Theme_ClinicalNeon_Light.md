# Logonaut Theme Specification: Clinical Neon (Light)

This document outlines the general visual goals and aesthetic for the "Clinical Neon" light theme for the Logonaut application. Specific color values, fonts, and control styles are defined in the corresponding XAML resource dictionary.

## Overall Aesthetic

*   **Core:** A modern, clean, predominantly flat design based on light backgrounds (white and off-white). Subtle depth may be introduced via clean borders or very light shadows for panel separation.
*   **Feel:** Professional, clinical, prioritizing high clarity and readability for log analysis.
*   **Emphasis:** A distinct, vibrant "neon" accent color (e.g., electric cyan/blue) is used purposefully for interaction feedback and highlighting focus/selection states. This accent should stand out clearly against the light background.
*   **Interactivity/Focus:** The neon accent color is primarily applied through solid borders (e.g., on focused text boxes, combo boxes) or background fills (e.g., for selected items in lists/trees, active toggles). Strong glow effects should be avoided to maintain the clean aesthetic; subtle inset effects might be used for pressed button states.
*   **Readability:** Text contrast must be high (near-black text on light backgrounds). Secondary information or UI elements use lighter grey tones.
